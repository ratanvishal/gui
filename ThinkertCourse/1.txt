The United States and Europe have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants, Netherlands-based Airbus and US-based Boeing Co, to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
The case, which has been grinding its way through the World Trade Organization for almost 15 years, is approaching the final stages of arbitration.
"The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!" Trump said on Twitter. "The EU has taken advantage of the US on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"
Trump's public attack on the EU came even as his administration has yet to hammer out trade deals with China and neighbours Mexico and Canada.
A day earlier, the US Trade Representative proposed targeting a list of EU products for tariffs, ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine, as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The final list is expected this summer.
In response, the European Commission said earlier Tuesday it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
"The Commission is starting preparations so that the EU can promptly take action based on the arbitrator's decision on retaliation rights in this case," a Commission spokesman said. "The European Union remains open for discussions with the United States, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome."
