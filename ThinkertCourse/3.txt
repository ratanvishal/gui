It was a battle to reclaim the top spot for Chennai Super Kings, and boy did they fight for it. Winning the toss, MS Dhoni sent Kolkata Knight Riders to bat first on a track where the ball had turned quite a bit this season. The scores were expected to be around 150-160 but KKR’s batting order failed them today and besides Andre Russell, there wasn’t much resistance. CSK struck early in the first two overs itself and cripple KKR with their spinners.
